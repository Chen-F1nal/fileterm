# FileTerm application icons

## Scope and source artwork

This skill covers the branded application icon and its operating-system assets. For file-type, folder, or general renderer icons, use the [common-components skill](../fileterm-common-components/SKILL.md).

Read [platform and protocol contracts](../../../docs/quality/agent-platform-contracts.md) before changing platform outputs. The editable Icon Composer projects live in `apps/tauri/assets/icons/source/`. Export the Windows/Linux full-bleed masters directly to `apps/tauri/src-tauri/icons/app/shared/{classic,material,clean}-1024.png`; keep the macOS Dock images in `apps/tauri/src/renderer/assets/app-icons/dock-{classic,material,clean}.png`.

The source projects are `FileTerm.icon`, `FileTerm-material.icon`, and `FileTerm-clean.icon`, matching the classic, material, and clean variants. Their standalone SVG directories are `svg/`, `svg-material/`, and `svg-clean/`.

The 1024px Dock images keep a 100px transparent inset on each side (about 9.8%). macOS needs this inset so the icon does not look oversized. Windows/Linux exports have alpha bounds `(0, 0, 1024, 1024)`, with no macOS safety inset; transparent corners belonging to the icon shape are preserved. Export these masters from the layered source rather than enlarging a cropped 824px Dock bitmap or a 256/512px output.

## Platform differences

Taskbar and Dock icons use 1024×1024px artwork on all three platforms. Windows/Linux use full-bleed masters; macOS keeps its safety inset. Do not upscale a small tray bitmap for the taskbar or Dock.

- **macOS:** the Dock uses `dock-*.png`; Finder, Launchpad, and the packaged app use the checked-in `apps/tauri/src-tauri/icons/app/macos/icon.icns`. The generator does not update either macOS asset. Update or verify the static ICNS separately when the default artwork changes. The menu-bar template icons in `icons/tray/macos/` are a separate monochrome asset family.
- **Windows:** both runtime window HICONs use 1024px PNGs through `CreateIconFromResourceEx`; Windows scales them for the taskbar and other window surfaces. The tray uses the derived 256px PNG. Shortcut/install ICOs retain their standard 16–256px frames and are generated from the 1024px master; do not try to put a nonstandard 1024px frame into these ICOs.
- **Linux:** windows and runtime launchers use 1024px images from `icons/app/shared/`. Packages install the classic 1024px image into hicolor and pixmaps, alongside the smaller hicolor sizes. Package icons and tray images are full-bleed 8-bit RGBA. Preserve user-customized icons when changing launcher refresh behavior.

## Updating a variant

1. Edit the relevant layered `.icon` project. Export its Default rendition at 1024×1024px, scale 1, directly to `icons/app/shared/<variant>-1024.png` with Icon Composer or its bundled `ictool --export-image`. If also updating macOS, keep the 100px transparent inset in the corresponding `dock-*.png`.
2. Run `uv run --with pillow python apps/tauri/scripts/generate-platform-app-icons.py` to normalize the masters to 8-bit sRGB RGBA and derive the 256/512px PNGs, ICOs, package icons, and tray assets. The script validates their dimensions and alpha bounds. Icon Composer can export 16-bit Display P3 PNGs; native RGBA loaders do not apply the embedded color profile. Do not hand-edit derived outputs.
3. Review the generated diff and check the affected platform consumers. Preserve the macOS inset, full-bleed Windows/Linux artwork, and Linux 8-bit RGBA requirement.

Native Windows loading must still be checked on Windows; decoding the source PNG on macOS does not prove that HICON creation succeeded.
